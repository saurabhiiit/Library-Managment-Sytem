# Library-Managemnt-Portal
A library managment system is developed on Web2py framework in which:

1) Admin and Student have seperate login.

2) Admin can update the existing book store, update the student's info i.e, 
who has borrowed the book and the respective details and can also add new students.

3) Students can view the details of the book they have taken i.e, Due date,
Fines due etc.

4) Admin and student can perform the actions only once they login with their
unique Id and password.
